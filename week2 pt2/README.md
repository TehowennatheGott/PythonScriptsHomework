1. A for loop is a count-controlled loop, and a while loop is a condition-controlled loop. Explain the differences.

2. What happens when a break command is executed in a while loop?
  it ends the while loop
3. You must define a function before you can use it in your Python script. True or False? Explain your answer.
  yes, how can the program use a function it doesnt know how to use? the program looks line-by-line, just put your functions before where theyre needed
4. How do you define a default value for a function parameter?
  def function
5. How do you define a variable number of parameters in a function definition?
  with a variable, for example if I had N amounts of oranges, and I wanted to know how many there are using a count function, you would use count(N)
6. Local variables can only be referenced from inside the function where they are created.
  o True o False? Explain your answer.
    True, otherwise you would run out of usable variable names, like i or n. Additionally, functions are like self contained instances of code, with only one way in, and only one way out.
